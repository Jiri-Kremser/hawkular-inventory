== Hawkular's Tinkerpop SQL Backend

This is a toy backend for persisting the Tinkerpop Blueprints Graph database into an RDBMS. Performance is bad but it
is useful for checking the transactional behavior of Hawkular because it is much stricter about transaction handling
than Titan.

DO NOT USE THIS FOR ANYTHING AND DO NOT DEPLOY THIS TO HAWKULAR DIST.
